Doluwa Divisional Secretariat, September 20, 2023 â€“ A new chapter in community development unfolded today as the Doluwa Divisional Secretariat proudly inaugurated another special project under the Saviyak Community Basic Project. This initiative, aimed at enhancing the livelihoods of local residents, signifies a significant step forward in the ongoing progress of the Doluwa region.

With the gracious support of the Doluwa Divisional Secretary, this community project has come to life. The Saviyak Community Market, a central feature of this initiative, was officially opened, promising numerous benefits for the people of Doluwa and beyond.

The Saviyak Community Market serves as a platform for both officers of the Doluwa Divisional Secretariat and residents within the division to showcase their agricultural produce and products. This market is not only about selling crops but also surplus seeds, planting materials, and various other items cultivated through their hard work and dedication.

Local farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs now have a dedicated space to display and sell their goods, helping them connect with a broader customer base. The market is poised to become a hub of economic activity, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among the residents.

The Saviyak Community Market is more than just a marketplace; it represents a symbol of empowerment and self-sufficiency. It encourages sustainable practices, promotes local entrepreneurship, and provides a reliable avenue for community members to market their produce.

In her opening remarks, the Doluwa Divisional Secretary emphasized the importance of this project in bolstering the economic prospects of the region. She noted, "The Saviyak Community Market is a testament to our commitment to the welfare and progress of our community. It is a place where our hardworking residents can reap the rewards of their labor and contribute to the prosperity of Doluwa."

The market is expected to operate regularly, allowing residents to bring their goods and visitors to explore the diverse offerings. The Doluwa Divisional Secretariat has put in place mechanisms to ensure the smooth functioning and organization of the market.

As the Saviyak Community Basic Project continues to unfold in the Doluwa Divisional Secretariat, it is clear that this endeavor holds immense potential to uplift the lives of the people and strengthen the bonds of this vibrant community. The opening of the Saviyak Community Market is just one of the many steps taken toward a brighter future for Doluwa.
